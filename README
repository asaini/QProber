## Web Based Databases

This project consists of 2 parts:

### Part 1

Implements a web database classification algorithm that is described in 

```'QProber: A System for Automatic Classification of Hidden-Web Databases' by Gravano, Ipeirotis, and Sahami```

Part 1 tries to classify web databases using a meta searching, whereby a query is made to Bing. This query searches for particular keywords listed in a directory,say root.txt and classifies
database in a particular category by looking at the number of documents returned for those particular keywords

### Part 2

Implements a simplified version of content-summary extraction algorithm, which is fully described in 

```'Classification Aware Hidden-Web Text Database Selection' by Ipeirotis and Gravano```

Part 2 generates a dictionary containing all the terms listed on that website.

To run the program:
```sh
$ python qproberGeneric.py
```
Once running, it will ask for the following parameters

* Coverage Threshold
* Specificity Threshold
* Database Url

Here are a few examples of input parameters

```
Coverage Threshold 100
Specificity Threshold: 0.6
Database Url: www.diabetes.org

Coverage Threshold: 100
Specificity Threshold: 0.6
Database Url: www.microsoft.com
```
