Part 1 : Implements a web database classification algorithm that is described in "QProber: A System for Automatic Classification of Hidden-Web Databases" bye Gravano, Ipeirotis, and Sahami

Part 2 : Implements a simplified version of content-summary extraction algorithm, which is fully described in "Classification Aware Hidden-Web Text Database Selection" by Ipeirotis and Gravano

Coverage Threshold, Eg: 100
Specificity Threshold, Eg: 0.6
Database Url, Eg: www.diabetes.org

Coverage Threshold, Eg. 100
Specificity Threshold, Eg 0.6
